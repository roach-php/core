## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Added `Roach::collectSpider` method to start a spider run and return all scraped items.
- Added `array $context` parameter to `Roach::startSpider` and `Roach::collectSpider` to pass arbitrary
  context data to a spider when starting a run.
- Added `roach:run <spider>` command to start a spider through the CLI.
- Added `Roach::fake()` method to test that a run for a given spider was started

### Changed

- Requests dropped by downloader middleware are no longer affected by `requestDelay` (fixes #27)
- Move `spatie/browsershot` from a `require` to `suggest` as it's only necessary if the `ExecuteJavascriptMiddleware` is used.
  Remove `ext-exif` as a dependency for the same reason.

### Removed

- Removed default command from CLI. To start the REPL, you now need to explicitly invoke the `roach:shell <url>` command, instead.
